CMPT 276 Final Project Proposal (Project 8)
<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Name of Application: 
BGC Engineering Inventory System

## Problem: 
The problem is regarding not being able to manage inventory efficiently 
as the amount of equipment and employees are abundant.

## How is this problem being solved currently: 
BGC Engineering is currently using a mobile app to scan in & out barcodes 
and manually track equipment items. They felt that the app they are currently 
using is not suited towards their needs.

## How will our project solve their problem: 
This project will allow employees at BGC Engineering to efficiently scan 
and sign out information, manage inventory, and locate equipment across their 
various locations around the world. 

## Who is the target audience: 
This project will be used by BGC Engineering professionals.

## Features of Applications:
The main feature of this application is a barcode scanning functionality. 
The application must be able to declare an item lost and update the status of the item 
whether it’s found or not. In addition, if the barcode is not able to be scanned, the 
application must add the item by use of the barcode number. There are also other individual 
features that are a part of the application. This application has to register items with 
associated users that will be responsible for that piece of equipment. For instance, this 
application must be able to perform CRUD operations on the inventory that is scanned in or 
out of the system. Another feature of this application is the ability of login using different 
credentials such as system admin, basic user, and equipment manager. This application also must
be able to display all inventory whether it’s filtered by location or item.  At last, this 
application must also be able to send out emails whether it’s for returning an item or extending 
an item’s return period.

## Which external API is this project using?:
This application will use the Google Map API to visually showcase where the equipment is currently 
as compared to the user’s location.

## Is the amount of work required in this proposal enough for five group members?:
Yes, every member of the group believes this amount of work is reasonable.
